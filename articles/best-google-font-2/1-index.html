In the previous part, I've show the theory behind asynchronous web font stylesheet loading and illustrated the process of page loading with experiments around performance measurements. Based on this data, I'll show my technique loading fonts in the most efficient manner. At the end, I'll show how to make embed a font on a web page so that it's immediately used when rendering the page, without a FOUT.

## Advanced Loading: @lemuria/font

In part I, a number of times we've seen one drawback to preloading web fonts stylesheets dynamically even with the preload link: fonts won't begin to download immediately after the stylesheet is downloaded, but only only at the initial *render stage* <span style="background:rgb(166,144,232)">Recalculate styles | Layout</span>, or after it if the stylesheet didn't have time to load before the first render. I've repeated the previous experiment multiple times, and I always see the same result, that the font download happens only at the purple render bar and never before it, even if the stylesheet is ready. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to start downloading fonts as soon as we have the fonts' urls? Plus, we're still to consolidate all reflows. The proposed solution is JavaScript-based:

<ul>
  * Preload the stylesheet as a `fetch` resource.
  * Instead of adding the link with the stylesheet to DOM, download it using XHR.
  * Parse the stylesheet with JS to extract `url()` links to fonts, add them do DOM as `link` with _rel_=<strong>preload</strong> _as_=<strong>font</strong>. This will kick in downloading the fonts.
  * Wait for all fonts to load, then embed the stylesheet as inline style. This will result in a single reflow.
  * If the browser doesn't support preload, just fallback to standard font loading.
</ul>

Let's get to code right away. Here's a simple script to fetch stylesheet, while measuring performance:

<js alt="The main idea behind the _Advanced Google Font_ strategy is to handle loading of fonts programmatically. By taking control over assets loading process, we'll be able to inject all fonts at once in a so-called _fonts flush_, thus reducing the number of reflows to just one.
To find out the URLs of fonts, we fetch the stylesheet with a simple XHR request." src="./animate/css.gif" img="css fetch by lasso animation">
  <highlightjs src="./examples/fetch.mjs"/>
</js>
<js reverse alt="The standard google fonts stylesheet contains a number of `@font-face` records with CSS properties. The `unicode-range` property allows to download fonts only if the page contains characters from that range, and it's annotated just above the record." src="./animate/fontface.gif" img="latin font face animation">
```css
/* latin-ext */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Gentium Basic';
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-display: swap;
  src:  local('GentiumBasic-Italic'), url(woff2) format('https://woff2');
  unicode-range: U+0100-024F, U+0259, ...etc;
}
/* latin */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Gentium Basic';
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-display: swap;
  src: local('GentiumBasic-Italic'), url(woff2) format('https://woff2');
  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, ...etc;
}
```
</js>

<js alt="Our stylesheet parsing function uses a regex to extract URLs with unicode ranges of fonts, and creates an array like `[{ font: 'https://woff2', range: /[regex]/ }]` for each font it found in the stylesheet.
The `U+0000-00FF,U+0131,...` range will become `[\u0000-\u00FF\\u0131...]` JS regex.">
```js
function parseBody(result) {
  const re = /url\((.+?)\).*?;\s+unicode-range: (.+?);/g
  let ranges = {}
  const fonts = []
  let a
  while((a = re.exec(result))) {
    const u = a[1]
    const range = a[2]
    fonts.push({ url: u, range })
    ranges[range] = 1
  }
  ranges = Object.keys(ranges).reduce((acc, range) => {
    const reg = range
      .split(/,\s/)
      .map((r) => r.replace('U+', '\\u').replace('-', '-\\u'))
      .join('').toLowerCase()
    acc[range] = new RegExp(`[${reg}]`)
    return acc
  }, {})
  // ...
```
</js>

<js id="two-scenarios" alt="There are 2 scenarios when we'll get the stylesheet ready:
 A) _after_ HTML parsing, when `body` is available. By running the regex against body's text content, we can figure out if we don't use *latin-ext* on the page, and just pass the unicode range for *latin* characters. This way, we don't have to download each single font in the stylesheet, wasting data; _and_
 B) _prior_ to HTML parsing, which can happen because there's another stylesheet blocking the render, and/or because the connection is very fast. Here, we wouldn't know the unicode ranges that are present on the page, therefore they have to be supplied as additional information. " src="./animate/head2.gif" img="body not ready animation">
```js
  // ..
  const body = document.body ? document.body.textContent : ''
  const validRanges = body ? Object.keys(ranges).reduce((acc, range) => {

    // case A) body is loaded, test it against the regex.
    const reg = ranges[range]
    const valid = reg.test(body)
    if (valid) acc[range] = true
    return acc
  }, {}) : Object.keys(ranges).reduce((acc, range) => {

    // case B) body is not available, fallback to supplied ranges.
    const valid = range in defaultRanges
    if (valid) acc[range] = true
    return acc
  }, {})

  // filter only fonts we need
  urls = fonts.filter(({ range }) => {
    return range in validRanges
  }).map(({ url: u }) => u)

  // if ranges are not supplied, and we're in case A, just add the stylesheet.
  // we loose the advantage of eliminating continuous reflows due to fonts
  // arriving independently at different times.
  if (!urls.length) return loadedCb()

  // preload fonts via link elements
  // each appendChild has a cost, so bundle them into a fragment.
  const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment()
  urls.forEach((address, i) => {
    const link = document.createElement('link')
    link.href = address
    link.rel = 'preload'
    link.as = 'font'
    const j = i + 1
    performance.mark('link-preload-start'+j)
    link.onload = () => loadedCb(j)
    link.setAttribute('crossorigin', true)
    fragment.appendChild(link)
  })
  document.head.appendChild(fragment)
}
```
</js>

<js reverse alt="Finally I add some logic to keep track of parallel preloads and to embed the stylesheet when they all arrive, and write the `startPreload` function to wire all functions up together.
The argument `i` would not be set if there were no valid URLs to load, e.g., in case B when no unicode ranges were passed, therefore I skip performance measurement there. The measure function will throw runtime error instead of warning, so one should be careful with it." src="./animate/lever.gif" img="3 Fonts shishi-odoshi animation.">

</js>

I could have used the `fetch` instead of XHR since it's 2019, however I would need to add a polyfill and transpile async code. There's no performance difference between `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` APIs. One observation, is that with `fetch`, data could be streamed, so if the response arrived in chunks, I could extract fonts as they come, but because the stylesheet is so small (&lt; 1kb), streaming is unnecessary. I've made a package called <npm-badge package="@lemuria/font">@lemuria/font</npm-badge> with this code which I ran through _Google Closure Compiler_, so let's update our page:

```

I've left plenty of performance markers, but there's a version that doesn't have them for smaller size. What does the resulting timeline look like? Have we solved the problem of throttling fonts' reflows?

  Advanced asynchronous Google Font performance: achieving single reflow.

<revision blue>
  * As soon as the page starts parsing, we begin the XHR request, but the CSS as fetch preload resource has already started downloading. The script evaluation takes _10ms_.
  - The download completes (purple line), but the thread is blocked so that the XHR has to wait until the main thread is free to execute the callback. Fonts don't begin to download but we can't do anything about it. Once the thread is available, the _@lemuria/font_ script inject 4 preload links and assign an `onload` listener to each them.
  * When all `onload` events have fired, the function adds the stylesheet to DOM as a style. Despite the fact that fonts arrived at different times, we only see one reflow which takes 100ms. The page's `onload` event is thus delivered quicker and the users and Google are happy.
</revision>

_OK Google_, we've achieved the maximum optimisation of your fonts consisting of gathering all fonts to flush them at once together with the stylesheet to have only a single reflow. Let's just see what if there's a render blocking resource, such as an external CSS that would give us some additional time to fetch the web font stylesheet:

<fig src="./graphics/dev9.png" id="before-body">
  @Lemuria/font parsing starting before body is available without default unicode-ranges.
</fig>

<revision blue reverse>
  * The advanced font loading script is executed, and taps into the preload download, but by the time the XHR is finished, the script cannot find `body` and there are no default unicode ranges. It falls back to essentially just appending a link tag with the style to the head.
  * The additional external stylesheet for our page begins to parse only now.
  * Fonts arrive one by one in 3 different waves.
</revision>

In this experiment, instead of inlining the page's style, I added a link to it, so that the browser had to download it. Although such download happens really quickly, the page nevertheless is slowed down by much more than just the download time. Unlike in the previous case, now when the `@lemuria/font` function has fetched the stylesheet and calls the XHR callback, the body is NOT yet available because the parsing has not started. This shows that it's not just the download job that increases the start up time for external stylesheets, but their loading time also: _total: 84.12 ms (15.12 ms network transfer + 69.01 ms resource loading)_ which would have been _0ms_ had the stylesheet been embedded and present for parsing immediately.

Again, this is my 2008 slow CPU MacBook but the idea is that when executing a script in the head, the body is not yet available since no parsing has begun. But the experiment above clearly shows that even though the body is not ready, we still could have had downloaded an external resource, for example a style, as browsers are really serious about such *critical* path assets due to the fact that they are REQUIRED to paint ANY content on a page. In the case of advanced google font technique, even though the preload is defined as *"fetch"*, it's still considered to be a CSS and has the highest download priority. In fact, it downloads so fast, the browser hasn't even begun properly parsing the page! In spite that it's an old laptop I was testing it on, _Lighthouse_ does apply CPU throttling when producing reports, and so probably does _Google_ for its page speed ranking measurements, so such experiments are worthwhile investments of time into improving the web development skill and understanding page speed optimisation principles. If your *performance* tab in the dev console is covered with cobweb, I'd suggest it's time to acknowledge its importance in today's competitive world of front-end development requiring high competence.
   <!-- because browsers take responsibility to spin off this external downloads as soon as they can, as it's *critical* resource paths, yet  -->

What the experiment showed was that because there were no default `unicode-ranges` to apply, the stylesheet was just embedded into the DOM as a fallback, so that the font flushing method didn't work. I'll show how to use unicode ranges in a sec, let's just take a short break.
