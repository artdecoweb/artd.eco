# The Best Way To Load Google Fonts Asynchronously

<avatar date="23 October 2019" />

<p>
  Traditionally my job as a developer was to build libraries in form of NPM packages and other software infrastructure for my [Node.JS Development Company](index), <tm>Art Deco™</tm>. However the most fun part of programming always was to make products for the Web, such as websites and integrate them with 3rd party APIs. Today, I focus on another aspect of web development, that is making web pages, that could even be static, but optimised for the modern day requirement of a web site: it must load extremely fast, and put performance in the first place.
</p>

<animation class="mb-3 text-center"
  src="./graphics/agf.png" alt="Advanced Google Font banner" width="550" height="400"
  path="./animate/agf.json" align="center" noscript="./animate/advanced-google-font.gif" />

<p>
  Because fast pages please users, the conversion rates are increased and SEO rankings receive a boost, therefore each no matter how small piece of optimisation can lead to an additional sale. So I was pondering of what actually the best way to load _Google Fonts_ is? In this article, I'll walk you through considerations of each steps on the ladder of progressively perfect optimisation of _Google Fonts_ loading, and show the best way to load _Google Fonts_ asynchronously that I've come up with. The method that I call
  <a class="TM3" href="articles/best-google-font">
    <tm class="TM2">Advanced Google Font</tm>
  </a>
  not only allows to load the web font stylesheet asynchronously but also:
</p>

<!-- <add-file>./graphics/parchment-svg.svg</add-file> -->

<bootstrap-div id="Advantages" position-relative>
  <img alt="papyrus background" src="./graphics/parchment-svg.svg" position-absolute top="0" left="0" right="0" bottom="0" style="width:100%; height:100%;" z-index="-1"/>
  <ul>
    * Reduces the delay before the font is loaded and can be applied to text, by discovering the most efficient way to <strong>preload</strong> the stylesheet. Have you ever set <span class="tm" style="background-color:#ffd386">＜link rel="preload" onload="this.rel = 'stylesheet'"＞</span>? Read on to find out if that's optimal.
    * Eliminates extraneous reflows of the page that happen a) after the stylesheet is applied, and b) after each font and its variations are downloaded (think 3+ reflows for 2 fonts you're loading), thus <strong>unblocking</strong> the main thread and improving the overall page load time.
    * Shows all variations of a font <strong>at the same time</strong>, without parts of text jumping on the page, which might be annoying to the user. The Flash of Unstyled Text (_FOUT_) is one thing, which is somewhat bearable by the user, but when many parts of the text (italic, bold) jump and flash it kind of looks unprofessional because it interferes with users' attention span.
  </ul>
</bootstrap-div>

<p>As a bonus at the end, I will show you a hack how to embed a font on a webpage for the critical path view, that is more advanced than just embedding a CSS with `data:application/font`-encoded base64 string with it, which might still result in a _FOUT_, but my bonus workaround eliminates the _FOUT_ completely.</p>
