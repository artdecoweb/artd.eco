Say, someone is looking for a web development company, they click a link to my website, and instantly they see a page that is branded with a font and opens in a split second. Would they be impressed? I think so. In other industries the value of extremely fast loading is probably more subtle and rests on the subconscious appreciation of an aesthetically pleasing fast website. But then again, optimisations like this are only the final polishing steps in producing an amazing website, that above all has impressive design and meaningful and engaging content. Still, here I'm describing it in such details because it helps to understand how browsers work so that we can apply this knowledge (rather than a specific method) in all of our work.
