## Page Speed Optimisation

Modern internet is much more sophisticated than it used to be, but still relies on the basic technology of HTML, CSS and JS. What's changed is the increased appreciation of the page performance since users now expect web sites to open quickly and be ready to interact within milliseconds. Every every single user is a prospect who can cost business a transaction if she is not happy with the UI. Additionally, Google encourages developers to account for performance by using it as a ranking factor in SEO, so that today it is not enough to draft some HTML with scripts and send it off to the client. A rigorous attention to the page loading process is required, and these articles explore how to debug web pages for speed performance. They will help to understand concepts of reflows, main thread blocks, preloads and how to design pages for faster loading times.

Likely, developers can embed fonts on a web page, be it a specially designed font for a particular brand, or a more available but still good looking font with an open source license. A number of online services like Google Fonts provide a way to embed fonts on a page easily. Despite the ease with which typography can be brought to a web page, there are some specifics for this area of page implementation process, for instance how to deliver fonts as fast as possible, and to make sure they play well with page performance. The articles here focus on fonts' asynchronous loading and FOUT and FOIT concepts that necessary to understand to deliver a strong brand image supported by users' appreciation of a web UI.
