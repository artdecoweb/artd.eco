# Inside UK's Technocracy And Mafia Behind It

The adulthood is certainly more difficult than most of us imagined as we discover the world built by corrupt self-righteous adults is properly unfair. In other words: life will kick you in the balls. Especially so when you think outside the box and have an independent world view which used to be completely normal when humans still had conscience, but now became a unique characteristic. The society that promises its members security, well paid jobs and fast cars, in exchange for them burning out lives for corporate interests, will betray anyone who decides to discover alternative paths, testing his/her vision and how much they really want to go their own way. One's goal is to persevere despite the challenge and develop a reality tunnel in which the problems that are faced are only to the advantage, to forge a personality that is capable of true success and not some cheap pastiche of a human achievement. I used to think that higher education, dedication to profession, and businessmanship were conservative qualities. Read my dare to struggle dare to win story to find out how perverted the neo-liberal Conservative party in the UK really is and how it has 0 British values left.

<!-- Today, I'll tell you my dare to struggle dare to win story as a background, and in the next article explain a set of 10 life lessons that I learned in the course of last year when a used a .sucks domain to build a website to put up a fight against UK's establishment. -->

<p overflow="hidden"><img placeholder-auto src="./img/prop.jpg" float="right" ml-3 alt="Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes"/> I'm now 26 years old, almost 27 and I had spent 10 years in England prior to August 2018, when with a help of the UK's corrupt pseudo-endorsing body in the technology sector I had to pack up my shit and leave, because Tech Nation, that provides Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visas for talented young individuals who can benefit the sector, in reality has hijacked the visa to exploit it as a loophole for venture-backed businesses invested in by its directors. A lot of people assume that the UK is a fair democracy and a developed country, and don't realise that it's being transformed into a close technocracy run by the elite &mdash; a bunch of amoral capitalists with links in the government who try to run a country like it's a start-up. Eventually they will end up like [`wework`](wework), and ruin the whole country, making people say `wemisswork`. To start real political education, everyone must [pick up this book](wiki-propaganda) from their local library to learn the basis of how technological societies function. Tech Nation is a mere propaganda tool the government uses to make their activity seem legit and justified as explained in this article.</p>

  <p font-size="medium">The 2011 website states: `The Tech City Investment Organisation (TCIO) is dedicated to driving investment to the area. They are on hand to share with you their know-how, giving practical support and networking advice to help your company succeed`.</p><p font-size="medium">Surely, an investment organisation is not really fit to decide who has natural abilities for programming and Software Engineering? Yet Tech Nation apparently IS an endorsing body, and although they've stepped up from simple "networking" advice to proper knee-deep, "government contacts" corruption scheme (see below), they still hire 0 professionals in computing who would be able to properly assess applications.</p>

The _Exceptionally Talented Visa_ route in the UK is the best one in the world, as it does not require you to have any capital when entering GB, and you can settle in the country in 3-5 years. However, when there are real endorsing bodies, such as _The Royal Academy of Engineering, Arts Council England, Royal Society_ and _British Society_ that were granted their Royal Charters and employ respectable fellows to process applications, Tech Nation used to be a little Shoreditch-based start-up that initially was helping the "silicon valley" of London, the Silicon Roundabout, with operations. In 2012, it was granted the "endorsing" body status by David Cameron, in the beginning of the government's bid to develop "tech" economy that benefits the establishment at the expense of tax payers and call it by the nice name "_Industrial Strategy_", using the myth of technological progress as a pretence to hide the real activity of industrialised corruption behind people's gullibility triggered by the idea that progress = better.

By the way, there's already an organisation called _British Computer Society_ which has the ability to provide IT professionals with a [charter](bcs) (in Engineering, chartering is normal but not when you're a Software Engineer for some reason), but it's not nearly as good as Tech Nation to do the job: _BCS_ actually has Computer Scientists (who number 0 at Tech Nation) and the Royal Charter (that numbers -1 at Tech Nation), but only when you have 0 honour, you can do the job that Tech Nation is doing.

Don't believe me? Here's a sneak peek into their scheme and how Tech Nation is playing its dirty role in it. I single out each player in this unfolding techno-capitalist drama and briefly critique them to draw a bigger picture. Let's just start by looking at the key figure from the [list of directors](ch-tn) of Tech Nation, and set off from there.
