## Summary

Let's just remember quickly what Jewish Former Minister of Defence, Emanuel Shinwell said when the Parliament had to vote on 30th of October 1956, during the Suez Canal crisis:

<block-quote>The utmost contempt for those Jews, including British MPs who, though professional Zionists, claim to see in Israel's action an offence against international law. They ought to be ashamed. Jews defending themselves against persecution and aggression have my full support ...</block-quote>

The professional Zionist Shinwell shames those who voted against British interference in the Suez because apparently Israel was just defending itself. Well, as it really turned out, it was British + French + Israeli conspiracy known as [Protocol of Sèvres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_of_S%C3%A8vres) to attack Egypt which failed miserably after the US didn't join them and their real motives were uncovered. My point being, everyone has and always will be shamed for even mentioning the word Jew in a conversation which is unfavourable to someone who wants to use his/her Jewish identity to cover up their dirty deeds. When Ireland passed the sanctions on Israel, being the first ever country to act on the violations of international law by Israel, who occupies Syrian and Palestinian land, they were immediately called anti-semitic by Netanyahu's office.

On 25 November 1940, Jewish paramilitary organisation in Mandatory Palestine Haganah, planted and detonated a bomb on _SS Patria_ ocean liner, killing 267 people and injuring 172. They did in because British authorities were deporting about 1,800 Jewish refugees that previously came from Nazi-occupied Europe from Palestine because they didn't have visas. Zionists didn't like this fact because they wanted all Jews to remain. So what do they do? They bomb these poor people who were saved from Nazis, themselves. This is just so you get the picture whether Zionists and Israel have really anything to do with Judaism.

PS. If you think Israeli tech is really great, you should remember how when in the most crucial moment when it was needed, that is during the 7/7 London bombings, none of the security cameras installed on London buses could record the videos. Just like these security systems, the new health systems of the UK will also fail when relied upon the most. After they put 5G in there, people will start getting brain cancers. THEY will see this data, and install more 5G antennas, BenevolentAI will come up with a medicine against it, and it will be distributed to you by post via the Echo App. You're all now slaves in the UK's technocratic society and there's no exit.

What I want, is for Tech Nation to be properly investigated with a special commission that would reveal the truth that not a single expert is ever involved in the decision process. I want GovTech to cease to exist, and be replaced by *BritTech* / *Britech* or *BritishTech*, a 100% high-quality home GB technology that can be exported, a nation-wide software company that receives the requirements from the government and implements them. After young people complete university degrees in Computer Science (and its branches including Security, AI), they can go work there on projects that are required for the country, and not for corporations. This will unite people, give them a national idea and actually restore the communal values, which has been completely destroyed by "innovators" who are only there to stick their filthy hands into the money pot, for which the population works so hard.

    ## Britech™: The British Software

    Software can and should be made using requirements specification, with waterfall/agile methodology. THEY brainwash everyone that some kind of magical innovation from foreign countries is needed, charge 1000x, 10000x, 100000x the worth of their fake IT products, and keep smiling like that's OK. THEY are the enemies who will result in complete elimination of national creative companies that won't afford to pay rent because of all the venture capital. THEY are the reason why no one can live peacefully and enjoy the simplicity of life, but instead has to join the rat race when the interest rate devalues years' worth of the hard work.

    You MUST vote Labour to have the real old-school traditional *Great British* values in *Computing* to be restored so that you can live in a _FREE_, calm country, the country of men of covenant who have the deeper spiritual link with *God* who will always guide and protect them.

    ## ETC

    Hey guys, I wanted to make a video with the explanation about Tech Nation's atrocities but I've run out of time. For 1 year, I've been maintaining a web-site at technation.sucks with all the info there, but the real purpose of that was to work on my static website generator. It's been great time but when the video comes out, you'll be able to see in 2 secs that I speaketh the truth. I speak so passionately about software only because I know what I'm talking about.
