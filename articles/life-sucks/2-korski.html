### Public.IO &mdash;

<p><img src="./img/korski.jpg" float="right" alt="Daniel Korski From Daily Mail" webp="photo" />But who else was registered at White Bear Yard? Maybe just [PUBLIC.IO](ch-public) which moved out there in 2018: *Registered office address changed from White Bear Yard 144a Clerkenwell Road London EC1R 5DF United Kingdom to 25 Eccleston Place London SW1W 9NF on 7 February 2018*. This company is a $100+ mil fund run by Daniel Korski, former special adviser to David Cameron who set up Public.IO just 5 days after Cameron resigned, to offer "growth programs" to businesses wanting to sell to government, or the so-called "gov-tech", i.e., money laundering scheme consisting of securing government contracts through bought officials in Westminster, however it's not illegal because well that's how institutionalised corruption in England works nowadays. The logic goes: if you *yourself* believe what you're doing to rob people of a country is legit, then it must be. Typical capitalist thinking: according to [Daily Mail](dm-korski), PublicIO "offers access to advisers working at the highest levels in government", including advisers for *Health Secretary* Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Amber Rudd. In fact, the same article mentions how Burbidge was appointed by Korski, so obviously they are good pals and form what I call "the establishment".</p>

But so what Burbidge is a partner at a venture capital based firm, it doesn't stop her from being a director of Tech Nation, right (actually before her, it was run by a non-venture capitalist and was pretty useless)? I wouldn't object if Tech Nation was a private company helping all these "tech startups" using their own venture capitals but do they? No, they are sponsored by the Government and are paid &pound;5 mil annually from tax payers' money, so that a bunch of people, who are already rich, can have "favourable" conditions. And you know, fuck them overall and let them play their little "build your own technology" constructor with nurses' and each other member's of the society money, but not only do they force their technology bubble hype upon the whole country, but *ALSO* actively sabotage applications for visas of people like me who just think differently from them and is not part of their "who is your investor" game. The real nature of Tech Nation's activity is proved by the screenshot below, which is also completely aligned with Korski's own policy of PublicIO.

  <p font-size="medium">So it is _OK_ now in a developed country to set up agencies that provide with "direct contacts in Government"? It's nuts! But that's the "liberal" economy for you. Liberal in a sense that the establishment is so free to do whatever they want to without any rules.</p>
  <p font-size="medium">There are different strands of capitalism, and the liberal one is the most disgusting one, because when in Germany, you go to the bank, get a loan for your business and try to make it like everyone else, here in London, you just have to receive investment from an investor from the establishment and you're a self-made entrepreneur!</p>
