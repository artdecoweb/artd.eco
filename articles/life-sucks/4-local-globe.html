    Right, maybe things are not so bad, it's just a bunch of capitalists helping each other? OK let's look at another Tech Nation's ex director, *Robin Klein* (22 September 2015 &mdash; 15 June 2018) who together with his son Saul founded _LocalGlobe_, a seed round investment fund. LocalGlobal, apart from many other investment, also [invests](crunch-echo) in a company called Echo, which invents an alarm for taking medicine, and allows to order your prescription via an app (ofc this is super high-tech innovation isn't it). Personally, I think it's a ridiculous idea: Echo's founder said that he suffered from depression so that he wanted to get his antidepressants via post. That's just stupid, if you have depression, what you need to do is to get out as much as possible, and use any excuse to visit the outside world and interact with other humans. That allows the healthy flow of serotonin and actually improves the mood and heals your depression.

    On the other hand, ordering anti-depression pills via post, will isolate you even more wouldn't it? But that's exactly what _Tech Nation_ and the Government want, to destroy any normal human ways of living, transform a society into a technocracy in which everyone is depressed, send them their pills by post, while streamlining all the public money into the pockets of the elite. Look just how much Tech Nation is happy for the acquisition of Echo by an American pharma company. The reason these corrupt liars who are pretending to benefit the society are so happy is actually because their director, Robin Klein, is going to be making money off the population.

But that's not all, not at all. Their high innovation multi-million alarm clock for taking medicine would be absolutely useless, if not their affiliation with NHS. There's a new branch of NHS, which is called NHSX, that was put there, by official version, to digitalise the National Health Service and modernise it. The real reason this unit is there, like the whole of the UK's capitalist technology, is to funnel the money out of the treasury into capitalists' hands and present it like they are doing a service to the society, and improving the standard of living. Who else, except for Tech Nation is excited about the Echo acquisition?

    Of course Saul is happy for his daddy's successful exit. The more money the better. But you might be wondering who is `@matthewsgould`, and why Saul is cc'ing him at such an exciting moment? Well, Matthew Gould is his old pal, who was a British ambassador to Israel, when Mr Klein was the UK's first tech envoy to Israel, announced by David Cameron himself in Dec 2012, around the same time all this Tech Nation's thing started.

Mr [Cameron said](tic) that the UK “wants to work much more closely with Israel on innovation and technology.“, and in fact the British Embassy in Israel has been transformed into a tech hub, because apparently GB and Israel as such great friends. Just so we're on the same page, Kleins, Gould and Cameron, Korski are all Jewish, in fact Matthew Gould is a passionate Zionist, whereas a Zionist, according to the <abbr title="World Zionist Organization">WZO</abbr> is *a Jew who understood the Zionist meaning of the Jewish State and was prepare to sacrifice himself for it*. The truth is, Cameron as well as Boris Johnson also declared themselves Zionists, and Cameron received &pound;1m from British Jewery without which he would never have been a PM. And you still think the UK is a democracy in any way? I learned a new word this year and it's "plutocracy", and I think it's essential that everyone knows its meaning in today's corrupt degenerate world.
