### Tech Nation &mdash;

Also how come Tech Nation, a processor of Exceptional Talent Tier 1 applications, is allowed to provide "expert assistance" with the applications? Does that not sound like a conflict of interest, and also why _should_ they provide such assistance, when the visa is for talented independent individuals and not really for tech businesses per se? This is because the visa is not for exceptionally talented, skilled young and passionate people. It is the visa for the talent farm of this startup ecosystem, where new little companies under the capitalists' patronage that don't want to provide proper sponsorship to employees, use the Tech Nation visa as a loophole to hire "talent" who is not talent at all, but are typical workforce in the IT. Economists don't have the ET1 visa, nor do lawyers, because they just do their job. This is what 99% of all Tech Nation visa holders do, just their job. But people who deserve it the most, for whom Software Development and Computing, is the real creative process, like it would be for a proper artist, have to be discriminated against by a pseudo-endorsing body that thinks it's an authority to decide who can start businesses in the UK, which is not even legal according to the European legal framework (E-commerce directive):

<block-quote>1. Member States shall ensure that the taking up and pursuit of the activity of an information society service provider may not be made subject to prior authorisation or any other requirement having equivalent effect.</block-quote>

This rule is there because it's essential human freedom of anyone to start a business, especially a digital one, today. It's like the freedom of speech. Can you imagine how offended you would be if there would be someone that you would have to go to ask to start a business, and they refused you that? You'd be enraged. Well, that's what Tech Nation has done to me, by lying about all of my achievements that I submitted to them in the application.

I mentioned creativity just above, because I don't think I'm a developer, I'm an artist and a master of my craft. My company is called {{ company }}, and you can't get more art than that when you own a software company. Software development is the thing I do best in life, because I express myself with it finding an escape, and because there are techniques and processes, like in any other art, that are employed to achieve the result &mdash; testing, documentation, transpilation and building. For each of them, I created my own tool that matches my criteria of quality: <npm-badge package="zoroaster">Zoroaster</npm-badge> context-testing framework, <npm-badge package="documentary">Documentary</npm-badge> documentation engine, <npm-badge package="alamode">Ã€LaMode</npm-badge> transpiler for modules and JSX, <npm-badge package="depack">Depack</npm-badge> compiler that is the only one to use Google Closure Compiler to build Node.JS packages and <npm-badge package="splendid">Splendid</npm-badge> to build super-performant websites for the modern web like this one.

<fig src="./img/rand.jpeg" no-fluid webp="photo" alt="Howard Roark: I don't intend to build in order to have clients. I intend to have clients in order to build.">

  The whole of the infrastructure is built from scratch with my own 200 packages, and you know what Tech Nation Tell me? That my software is "tools that nobody uses built using a number frameworks". These are words of a "professional highly-qualified expert in the field" lol when I show that I CREATE frameworks and not use them. Like just stop for a sec and think how this pure libel makes me feel &mdash; OK I know this is a lie, but there are other people reading this like the Home Office who don't know that Tech Nation are corrupt bastards. This is when my software is 100% Open Source, really improves productivity and pays utmost attention to developer experience. The word *talent* means _natural aptitude or skill_ but Tech Nation only recruit propaganda puppets calling themselves Tech Nation visa holders to put the smoke in the eyes of public "how well the UK is doing helping the technology sector" without being able to show a single package. The reason I didn't get the visa is because I'm an Open Source developer, and it's not to the advantage of capitalists to help Open Source. Tech Nation is supposed to be an independent endorsing body for the technology sector, but instead, they are just capitalists' flunkeys sabotaging the UK's economy and abusing candidates while being on public payroll.

  Moreover, _Art Deco_ is a style that emerged exactly 100 years ago, as a way to reconcile the newest technological processes with human culture. Deco starts for decoratif, because you don't want to live in a sterile factory-like environment, and have to introduce motives from nature, use materials like wood, i.e. to attribute to proper _culture_ that is in the deepest core of the human being. Art Deco is for everyone who want to believe in a powerful human spirit and be religious but without affiliation with those who speak what they know not of. Tech Nation is then precisely the degeneration of culture, when everything is bought with money, there is no respect for human beings and everything is synthetic.
