### Tech Nation &mdash;

Also how come Tech Nation, a processor of Exceptional Talent Tier 1 applications, is allowed to provide "expert assistance" with the applications? Does that not sound like a conflict of interest, and also why _should_ they provide such assistance, when the visa is for talented independent individuals and not really for tech businesses per se? This is because the visa is not for exceptionally talented, skilled young and passionate people. It is the visa for talent farm of this startup ecosystem, who don't want to provide proper sponsorship to employees, so they use the Tech Nation visa as a loophole to hire "talent" who is not talent at all, but are typical workforce in the IT. Economists don't have the ET1 visa, nor do lawyers, because they just do their job. This is what 99% of all Tech Nation visa holders do, just their job. But people who deserve it the most, for whom Software Development and Computing, is the real creative process, like it would be for a proper artist, have to be discriminated against by a pseudo-endorsing body that thinks it's an authority to decide who can start businesses in the UK, which is not even legal according to the European legal framework:

<block-quote>1. Member States shall ensure that the taking up and pursuit of the activity of an information society service provider may not be made subject to prior authorisation or any other requirement having equivalent effect.</block-quote>

This rule is there because it's essential human freedom of anyone to start a business, especially a digital one, today. It's like the freedom of speech. Can you imagine how offended you would be if there would be someone that you would have to go to ask to start a business, and they refused you that? You'd be enraged. Well, that's what Tech Nation has done to me, by lying about all of my achievements that I submitted to them in the application. For example, I mentioned creativity just above, because I don't think I'm a developer, I'm an artist and a master of my craft. This is the thing I do best in life, software development, because I express myself, and because there are techniques and processes, like in any other art, that are employed to achieve the result. My company is called {{ company }}, and you can't get more art than that when you own a software company. Moreover, _Art Deco_ is a style that emerged exactly 100 years ago, as a way to reconcile the newest technological processes with human culture. Deco starts for decoratif, because you don't want to live in a sterile factory-like environment, and have to introduce motives from nature, use materials like wood, i.e. to attribute to proper _culture_ that is in the deepest core of the human being. Tech Nation is precisely the degeneration of culture, when everything is bought with money, there is no respect for human beings and everything is synthetic.
