###Â Eileen BURBIDGE &mdash;

"American venture capitalist, founding partner at Passion Capital." (Forbes), and a chair at Tech Nation. The key is *venture capitalist*, because the whole of Tech Nation's purpose is to serve venture capitalists like Ms Burbidge and her friends. Her _Passion Capital_ company is located at White Bear Yard, Shoreditch and is a co-working space for trendy entrepreneurs, building "startups". In the [Wired Documentary](wired) (1:20), Ms Burbidge talks about how "more than a half, if not two-thirds, of the businesses are from foreign-born entrepreneurs". She says how fantastic it is, but she's a typical capitalist liar, who will say anything that presents reality in the light that supports their mode of power regardless of facts. If she is not a liar, why her company Tech Nation which I paid &pound;456 for processing of my application, is treating me like shit and robbing me of an opportunity to be a foreign-born entrepreneur and run a [Node.JS Development Company in London](/), which is what makes London so fantastic according to her?

Maybe I'm too harsh, she's just a director, she's not really aware of the unfair unethical practices at her company, or does she? The answer is yes she does, because after Tech Nation's Senior Manager lied about my application, I made a website, and sent it to each member of their useless team, consisting of 0 software engineers and who would have no idea who's actually telling the truth. I had a premium membership at the time and accumulated 45 credits, so right before Christmas Tech Nation's staff got a little message from me.

  Needless to say, none of the cowards dared to answer anything, because they are despicable traitors of the country who think they can give visas in technology without even knowing basics of computer programming and have no courage to really look into the issue, preferring to ignore it altogether. Fine for them, but a director of a company needs to investigate reports like that, yet Burbidge is JUST a dishonourable liar who's there to tell everyone how "fantastic" things are without leadership skills that would prompt her to ask me what happened.
