### NHSX &mdash;

##### Or iNHS, the Israeli branch of NHS

Back to Matthew Gould, he is the head of NHSX now, no wonder everyone in the establishment is so excited, they have a proper opportunity to rob the British population, and use a legitimate pretext like what they are doing is legal. But that's only part of the Gould's job. His mission in accordance with his Zionist ideology is make sure there's nothing great left of Great Britain, and it becomes a mere province of the Greater Israel:

"A lifetime membership to the UK government and key players", yeah sounds familiar already, not even getting shocked about this no more... Industrial Strategy they say. Pick a better name for it: Population Enslavement Strategy / Institutionalised Corruption Strategy / Elite Technocracy Strategy. Happy days for the UK, receiving healthcare AI from Israel when a child in occupied Gaza strip will most probably die from an ear infection. Oh yeah, sorry, “[This is not an occupation – this is a siege](siege).” We're just left to hope that Gould will have to answer to <nobr>G-d</nobr> when the time comes.

  <span color="blue">✡</span> [JUDAISM AND ZIONISM ARE NOT THE SAME THING](zionism):
  In their two thousand years of Divinely decreed exile no Jew ever sought to end this exile and establish independent political sovereignty anywhere. The people's sole purpose was the study and fulfilment of the Divine commandments of the Torah.

Sure it's getting bit heated but let me explain. There's no controversy here: any member of Abrahamic religion be it a Muslim, Jew or Christian, will tell you, that it's all about sovereignty of God. There's only one law, that is the God's law and he's the only one to be worshipped. Creating idols including nation states, is adultly. The state does not own a man, only God does. This is true especially for Jews, and orthodox rabbis confirm that. This truth is really easy to understand yet there's such little number of truly religious men that religion is used to brainwash people in national interests resulting in movements like Zionism that uses Jews as its human shield. That's why M.Gould is facing really serious consequences for his soul when he proclaims himself a Zionist. Not even to mention that corruption/unfair practices are not allowed in Judaism either:

    A lot of people have negative attitude towards Judaism, especially in England, where only Jews were allowed to lend money so people disliked the fact they had to pay them back. Hence, during the so-called first wave of Jewish immigration in the UK, by the end of 19th century, British Jewry was actually encouraging its youth to integrate so much, that many young Jews "felt more English than Jewish", and they married with other confessions at the rate of 30% which is really high. But today, it's not anyone's interest to integrate: just throw in anti-semitism accusations and you're good. Nobody's playing a fair game any more, there are techniques to rule the masses and they are being used by the secret police. _Tech Nation_ is one of those propaganda methods, sponsored by the population themselves.

    The world is a value-void totalitarian place divided between major nation states run by corporate/secret service mafia, while the Europeans are tamed with gadgets and cheap money printed by central banks for free. Where the higher dimension projects onto ours, we observe how conscienceless individuals like Korski and Gould who promise and implement direct contacts with members of Parliament via their favourable positions are causing anti-semitism themselves, and then hide behind backs of actually religious Jewish population serving <nobr>G-d</nobr> instead of money or states, but who has to face consequences of their corruption. I really do believe that Judaism is a fair, community-oriented religion, but Godless mafia consisting of Zionists and bought politicians who hold the office is what's giving it bad rep.

      <span color="blue">✡</span> [HASSAGAT GEVUL](hassagat) (Heb. הָסַּגַת גְּבוּל), a concept which originally had specific reference to the unlawful taking of another's land; later it was extended to embrace encroachment on various economic, commercial, and incorporeal rights of others. The original meaning of the term hassagat gevul was the moving (cf. nasogu aḥor, Isa. 42:17) of boundary stones or other landmarks from their resting places into the bounds of another's adjoining area of land, for the purpose of annexing a portion of the latter to one's own land.
      <br><br>Naḥmanides' comment on the passage, "Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it" (Deut. 19:14)

<p class="Land Style">For this reason, should a person go ahead and move the border of his property into his neighbors' land, he clearly declares his dissatisfaction with the portion he received from God. It's as if he says, "Sorry God, I think You made an error. You didn't give me enough." That's not just theft. That's a [direct affront](wood) to one's relationship with God. _Rabbi Reuven Spolter_</p>
<br><br>

The term "moving landmarks" or "moving stones" in broad terms means manipulating reality as to take what is not yours and prevent others from having what is theirs by the will of God. My business in the UK, was nobody else's business but mine and God's and part of my family's contract with him. Matthew Gould and all of his neo-Conservative mafia had no right to interfere, because Britain is not their country like they think. In fact, British in Hebrew means "man of the covenant" and Britain used to be a place with high moral standing before capitalism took over, ruined the essence of communal milieu here and made people worship money. Did you know that the Queen swears not to have any laws introduced, because the law of God is supposed to be enough? It also wasn't by chance that I happened to be in England setting up a company called Art Deco exactly 100 years after actual Art Deco happened so they are not only targeting me, they are attacking the whole of the cultural, creative and therefore spiritual community.

No jobs for British Computer Scientists there though." no-fluid>

  But it's OK isn't it, that's how the GAME goes for government PLAYERS? On the other hand, Matthew Gould is actually an honest hard working man, doing his job, and all my accusations of corruption have no real ground because it's actually not corruption, but an absolute normal way of doing things, since the country needs to invest its taxpayers money into the tech sector owned by a close group of friends with links in the government, and make sure these companies have direct access to the top-level government officials whenever they need to.

  Also no that's fine, let's give all medical data of a whole country to Israel for free, no not for free, let's pay them first, so that they can monitor how healthy the population is which is not a question of national security at all. Do you think there will be strict rules and regulations regarding the data protection? HAHAHA. Zionists will know everything about you. It's time to follow Ireland's lead and BAN Israeli tech, to impose sanctions and enforce divestment, so that they can leave Palestinians alone, not give them unlimited power over your medical data you fools.

My true beef with M.Gould is that actually, before NHSX, he was Director General for Digital and Media Policy in the _Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport_ wreaking havoc on UK's culture as proven by such degenerate institute as _Tech Nation_. DCMS is the department that sponsors evil Tech Nation with &pound;5m/year, i.e., he is the one who is directly responsible for Tech Nation's behaviour towards me and my business &mdash; I'll give you concrete evidence in a sec, but it's exactly because of his official patronage that Tech Nation feels so protected that they allow themselves to behave in the way they do.
