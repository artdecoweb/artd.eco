### NHSX &mdash;

Back to Matthew Gould, he is the head of NHSX now, no wonder everyone in the establishment is so excited, they have a proper opportunity to rob the British population, and use a legitimate pretext like what they are doing is legal. But that's only part of the the Gould's job. His mission is to make sure there's nothing great left of Great Britain, and it becomes a mere province of the Greater Israel:

  But it's OK isn't it? Matthew Gould is actually an honest hard working man, doing his job, and all my accusations of corruption have no real ground because it's actually not corruption, but an absolute normal way of doing things, since the country needs to invest its taxpayers money into the tech sector owned by a close group of friends with links in the government, and make sure these company have direct access to the top-level government officials whenever they need to. Also no that's fine, let's give all medical data of a whole country to Israel for free, no not for free, let's pay them first, so that they can monitor how healthy the population is which is not a question of national security at all.

  Actually, before NHSX, Mr Gould was Director General for Digital and Media Policy in the _Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport_, the department that sponsors Tech Nation with &pound;5m/year, i.e., he is the one who is directly responsible for Tech Nation's behaviour towards me and my business &mdash; I'll give you concrete evidence in a sec, but it's exactly because of his official patronage that Tech Nation feels so protected that they allow themselves to behave in a way they do.
