    # Privacy Policy

    By default, this website does not use any cookies, including from such services as _Google Analytics_.

We acquire the most basic with the least possible permissions that are possible to set: <code>[lite-profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile/lite-profile)</code> and <code>NO scope</code> for GitHub. When you decide to sign in to comment using `LinkedIn` and `GitHub` OAuth buttons, some cookies will be stored. They include 2 items: `koa:sess` and `koa:sign`. *koa:sess* is an encrypted collection of information which was obtained when you signed in, and *koa:sign* is the key to decrypt it on the server. The following personal data is recorded in the session cookie:

    <ul>
      * ``linkedin_user``: id (unique to our app, cannot be used to deduct your public LinkedIn profile), firstName, lastName, profilePicture.
      * ``github_user``: login, name, avatar_url, html_url. These are public fields that can be obtained by visiting your profile anonymously.
      * ``csrf``: the cross-site-request-forgery token that is required to for security reasons to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    </ul>

    Your *IP address* when leaving a comment will <ins>only</ins> be recorded if you're an anonymous user. If you have not logged in, we need to be able to somehow control and gather forensic evidence for security purposes. When you are logged in, the IP is not stored. Because your IP is recorded in log files, theoretically it becomes possible to connect your personal data with the activity on the website, but we don't purposefully do that. Therefore, we encourage logging in to prevent the possibility of connecting logs data with personal data.
