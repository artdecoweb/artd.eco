    ## _Node.JS_ &mdash; Your Language Of Choice
    <p>
      Software Engineering is an art, science and technology combined. It helps to automate processes and improve the standard of living, relieving humans of monotonous operations that can be solved using a computer program. 100 years ago, with the advent of new machinery, there was a promise for the future where people's time could be taken off of work, and put into spending their lives focusing on human tasks and communications. This has partly been achieved, but we have a long way to go still, and after reaching the required stage of progress in hardware, we are now peaking in the course of software evolution. The species that is increasingly dominating the environment and taking the central stage in this process of natural selection of the fittest is _Node.JS_. It is no surprise that in today's word, characterised by globalisation and interconnectedness, the programming language born on the web, is becoming _The One_ of the web, who will redeem it and remake it in the way it's supposed to be.
