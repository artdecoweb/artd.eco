    ## _Node.JS_ &mdash; Your Language Of Choice
    <p>
      Software Engineering is an art, science and technology combined. It helps to automate processes and improve the standard of living, relieving humans of monotonous operations that can be solved using a computer program. 100 years ago, with the advent of new machinery, there was a promise for the future where people's time could be taken off of work, and put into spending their lives focusing on human tasks and communications. This has partly been achieved, but we have a long way to go still, and after reaching the required stage of progress in hardware, we are now peaking in the course of software evolution. The species that is increasingly dominating the environment and taking the central stage in this process of natural selection of the fittest is _Node.JS_. It is no surprise that in today's word, characterised by globalisation and interconnectedness, the programming language born on the web, is becoming _The One_ of the web, who will redeem it and remake it in the way it's supposed to be.

      By bridging the gap between front-end development and back-end programming, and utilising the agility of functional paradigm together with the abstractions of OOP that help developer experience and documentation, _Node.JS_ is winning hearts and souls and finding hundreds of new fans, both indie developers as well as development companies, all over the world each day. The applications of today designed to connect services, users and automatons can benefit the most when they are written in _Node.JS_, and *Art Deco* specialises in this field of modern web computing, applying the best practises of classical software engineering such as thorough automated testing, documentation plentiful of examples, and user-centered design together with more present-day trends of cloud and serverless deployment, single-page and progressive web apps and open source code coordination techniques like NPM scopes and GitHub orgs that help to pass the codebase between ourselves and future teams. Our approach is that each program is a piece of art that can be perfected to the single line of code by employing a scientific method that consists of conducting research to understand the problem at hand, coming up with a possible solution, evaluating it against business requirements while rigorously and critically documenting the findings. The outcome is technology that is unique to each client, easy and pleasant to use for their customers and stakeholders, and straightforward to understand and maintain for other teams of developers.
