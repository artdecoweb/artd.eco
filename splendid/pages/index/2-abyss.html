    ## _Node.JS_ &mdash; Your Language Of Choice
    <p>
      Software Engineering is an art, science and technology combined. It helps to automate processes and improve the standard of living, relieving humans of monotonous operations that can be solved using a computer program. 100 years ago, with the advent of new machinery, there was a promise for the future where people's time could be taken off of work, and put into spending their lives focusing on human tasks and communications. This has partly been achieved, but we have a long way to go still, and after reaching the required stage of progress in hardware, we are now peaking in the course of software evolution. The species that is increasingly dominating the environment and taking the central stage in this process of natural selection of the fittest is _Node.JS_. It is no surprise that in today's word, characterised by globalisation and interconnectedness, the programming language born on the web, is becoming _The One_ of the web, who will redeem it and remake it in the way it's supposed to be.

      By bridging the gap between front-end development and back-end programming, and utilising the agility of functional paradigm together with the abstractions of OOP that help developer experience and documentation, _Node.JS_ is winning hearts and souls and finding hundreds of new fans, both indie developers as well as development companies, all over the world each day. The applications of today designed to connect services, users and automatons can benefit the most when they are written in _Node.JS_, and *Art Deco* specialises in this field of modern web computing, applying the best practises of classical software engineering such as thorough automated testing, documentation plentiful of examples, and user-centered design together with more present-day trends of cloud and serverless deployment, single-page and progressive web apps and open source code coordination techniques like NPM scopes and GitHub orgs that help to pass the codebase between ourselves and future teams. Our approach is that each program is a piece of art that can be perfected to the single line of code by employing a scientific method that consists of conducting research to understand the problem at hand, coming up with a possible solution, evaluating it against business requirements while rigorously and critically documenting the findings. The outcome is technology that is unique to each client, easy and pleasant to use for their customers and stakeholders, and straightforward to understand and maintain for other teams of developers.

          <p>In our code, we use both functional and object-oriented approaches according to the problem being solved, as well as the latest standard of JavaScript programming language with EcmaScript modules and the most up-to-date syntax including object spread and rest operators, arrow and async functions and JSX components. When others choose to stick to the previous version of the standard and keep using `require` statements instead of imports just because _Node.JS_ has not added the support for the later and install Babel for their _JSX_, we created our own 0-dependency transpiler [Ã€LaMode](/alamode.html), which offers a unique solution by transpiling the source code using regular expressions, and allows to write modern code without being paused by insufficiencies of the runtime. Like the transpiler, our implementations are free of external code and are straight to the point: they focus on solving the problem at hand with the maximum help of the language itself so that no client's time is wasted on setting up and adjusting 3rd party tools. If you're looking for a _Node.JS_ development company that shows it can implement its own toolchain for daily work and thus proves its expertise, rather than just takes a free solution used by everyone else, choose _Art Deco_. Then your software won't be like anyone else's.</p>

          <p>Quality Assurance is the field where _Art Deco_ is second to none. We have invented a testing framework called [_Zoroaster_](/zoroaster.html) that introduces the concept of context-testing into the JS world and helps us and other developers to keep their testing infrastructure separate from test cases' flow, document it and receive in-editor documentation hints on how to use its methods, verify its correctness to ensure double standard of quality assurance (the so-called _testing the tests_ practice), and share it across packages to save valuable time that will be spent on coding and writing tests. Most of our JavaScript functions are written in pure, functional style that allows them to undergo elementary unit-testing using the mask-testing feature of _Zoroaster_, where test logic for each method is setup only once, while we concentrate on comparing inputs to outputs in the most efficient manner. Final systems are covered by integration tests on different levels, including integration between modules as well as between APIs, browsers and cloud services. Automated testing not only proves the correctness of programs and their meeting of the requirements specification, but also serves as a regression basecamp that guarantees that any future changes won't break the existing implementation.
            <!-- At _Art Deco_, we don't just write tests at the end of the development cycle, we use them throughout the whole process. -->

            [_NPM_](https://npmjs.org) is the package manager for _Node.JS_ with almost 1 million packages being published online for free use. _Art Deco_ recognises the value of Open Source, but also exploits the infrastructure created by NPM that allows to solve the dependency management problem with the ease of mind: when writing software for ourselves and clients, we split designs into logical packages, and create them separately using our package bootstrapper [MNP](/mnp.html) (`my-new-package`) that spawns packages with the most up-to-date scaffolding. Smaller packages are then imported by larger ones, and all of them are published on NPM, either in private or public scopes (e.g., our Open Source projects). This approach ensures that any future software pieces can quickly install existing ones, whereas we save time and know that there's no bugs in installed code, because each package has been tested separately. Moreover, the philosophy behind packages is Unix-like, i.e., that programs should be simple and do mostly one thing, but do it really well. We have published over 150 packages that are really good in their implementation, testing and documentation, and when they are put together, they achieve tremendous results with superb quality. NPM allows us to apply the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle in practice of software engineering, and organise code by scopes: we can create a scope for our clients and share the access permissions with them, so that all the infrastructure can be handed over quickly, securely and responsibly.
