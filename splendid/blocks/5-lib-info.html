      ## Libraries
      <p style="background: #fffae6; padding:1rem; border-right: 2rem solid #ebdfa0;">
        A lib consists of a set of functions and classes to execute standard business operations, and exchange data with other data sources. When put together, the functions is the library are used by development team so that their correctness, reliability and user-friendliness take the priority when developing Node.JS libraries. Interfaces and constructors for class abstractions, and records for config object received and returned by functions are documented in an independent type api, simple XML files, from which they are exported for documentation, JSDoc and externs for the JavaScript compiler which is otherwise impossible. We have a build tool to compile libraries into the single NPM dependency with full JSDocumentation support. See the <npm-badge package="@goa/koa">@Goa/Koa</npm-badge> project for the example where Koa is built using libraries rewritten in ES6 and where IDE API provided just JSDoc.
