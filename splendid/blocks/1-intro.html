        PWAs are the bleeding edge of web technology that can be thought of as maximally optimised, highly performant websites, that in addition to working online, can be installed as an app on smartphones and accessed offline. They also allow to engage audience with in-browser notifications and help retain users, gain their loyalty and decrease churn. <a href="/pwa.html" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" tabindex="-1">Read More</a>

        APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are the back-end implementations that front-ends like PWAs talk to to exchange data. Traditionally run on a server, today they are often deployed on serverless architecture and are used to perform such business logic as updating data in the database, processing media files and communicating with 3rd party services. <a href="/api.html" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" tabindex="-1">Read More</a>
