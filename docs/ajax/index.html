We also create front-end applications and progressive web apps (PWAs) that connect to back-ends using the gold standard techniques of software engineering. Finally, we make novel developer tools of exceptional quality for ourselves, and contribute them to Open Source for thousands other developers. Art Deco creates noble software of outstanding standard and provides the best customer service to its customers.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <!-- <h1 class=\"font-effect-anaglyph\">Art Deco Code</h1> -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n      <p class=\"SectionBreak\"><a href=\"#top\" title=\"Back To Top\"><img src=\"section-breaks/0.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\" /></a></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"row d-flex\">\n  <div class=\"col\" id=\"node\">\n    <h2><em>Node.JS</em> &mdash; Your Language Of Choice</h2>\n    <p>\n      Software Engineering is an art, science and technology combined. It helps to automate processes and improve the standard of living, relieving humans of monotonous operations that can be solved using a computer program. 100 years ago, with the advent of new machinery, there was a promise for the future where people's time could be taken off of work, and put into spending their lives focusing on human tasks and communications. This has partly been achieved, but we have a long way to go still, and after reaching the required stage of progress in hardware, we are now peaking in the course of software evolution. The species that is increasingly dominating the environment and taking the central stage in this process of natural selection of the fittest is <em>Node.JS</em>. It is no surprise that in today's word, characterised by globalisation and interconnectedness, the programming language born on the web, is becoming <em>The One</em> of the web, who will redeem it and remake it in the way it's supposed to be.\n    </p>\n    \n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-lg-5 text-center align-self-center mb-3\">\n    <img alt=\"Node.JS at the epicenter of modern software development\" src=\"/img/Byss-und-Abyss.jpg\" class=\"img-fluid\"/>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"Adonais\" style=\"display:inline-block;float:left;position:relative;padding-right:1rem;\" id=\"c9848\"><img src=\"img/adonais/back.jpg\" style=\"position:relative; opacity:0;\" /><img src=\"img/adonais/back.jpg\" /><img class=\"A\" src=\"img/adonais/a2.png\" style=\"top:112px;left:219px;\" /></span>\n      By bridging the gap between front-end development and back-end programming, and utilising the agility of functional paradigm together with the abstractions of OOP that help developer experience and documentation, <em>Node.JS</em> is winning hearts and souls and finding hundreds of new fans, both indie developers as well as development companies, all over the world each day. The applications of today designed to connect services, users and automatons can benefit the most when they are written in <em>Node.JS</em>, and <strong>Art Deco</strong> specialises in this field of modern web computing, applying the best practises of classical software engineering such as thorough automated testing, documentation plentiful of examples, and user-centered design together with more present-day trends of cloud and serverless deployment, single-page and progressive web apps and open source code coordination techniques like NPM scopes and GitHub orgs that help to pass the codebase between ourselves and future teams. Our approach is that each program is a piece of art that can be perfected to the single line of code by employing a scientific method that consists of conducting research to understand the problem at hand, coming up with a possible solution, evaluating it against business requirements while rigorously and critically documenting the findings. The outcome is technology that is unique to each client, easy and pleasant to use for their customers and stakeholders, and straightforward to understand and maintain for other teams of developers.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"SectionBreak\"><a href=\"#top\" title=\"Back To Top\"><img src=\"section-breaks/1.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\" /></a></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"row d-flex\">\n  <div class=\"col\" id=\"packages\">\n    <h2>Regenerating <em>Node.JS</em> Ecosystem</h2>\n    <p>\n      <em>Node.JS</em>, the most modern programming language of today, has risen as a reaction to traditional heavy applications that take ages to compile, an army of administrators to manage, and cost enormous amount of money to introduce and maintain. The <em>Node.JS</em> runtime, on the other hand, based on the <em>JavaScript</em> programming language, has given independent developers and smaller teams freedom to write fast, easily deployable and testable software systems that transform from a prototype to production in a matter of days, not years.\n\n      However, the ecosystem's direction of growth around <span class=\"Node TM\">Node.JS</span> and its package manager <span class=\"NPM TM\">NPM</span> has been hijacked by corporations, that want to dictate their own terms of use: <span class=\"Corp\">Microsoft</span> would like people to use <span class=\"Typescript TM\">TypeScript</span> instead of <span class=\"JavaScript TM\">JavaScript</span> and is successfully advocating it by playing on the fact that students are mostly taught Java at Universities, so that they tend to choose what they know, that is, a typed object-oriented programming language; and <span class=\"Corp\">Facebook</span> is dominating the field of web-development by maintaining the <span class=\"React TM\">React</span> library tied up to such tools as <del>Babel and Jest</del>, which are gigantic in size and contain bugs. Moreover, there's no need to pretend that these companies are doing it for free: every developer won will result in either marketing, power or financial gains to them. The main issue is that to solve simple problems, the solutions employed are unnecessary complex, involve installing 1000s of dependencies for a product at hand, and lock developers in the mode of thinking and working prescribed by someone else. JavaScript and Node.JS were once about freedom, opennes to experimentation and close friendly community, and now, like all good things that become popular, it is poisoned by ignorance, unprofessionalism and the belief system that anyone who has installed a 3rd party dependency, is an expert developer and those who don't agree with the paradigms established by corporations are weird outsiders. Art Deco aims to restore the intrinsic philosophy behind JavaScript and Node.JS as open-minded, efficient and solution-focused instruments and regenerates the development process of back-end and front-end applications with utilities that are simply sophisticated and sophisticatedly simple, for ourselves, and others, so that the work process comprises purely of writing code, tests and documentation with minimal tint of branded technology but maximum productivity. In other words, Art Deco makes tools for developers, rather than making developers its tools.\n\n      <!-- and contain bugs which could be noticed by anyone with a little bit experience, but are kept open for years because the field is not dominated by professionals anymore. -->\n      <!-- and sin by paying no attention to the documentation techniques used by plain JS developers. Whereas ignorance is bliss for the masses, Art Deco rejects the poor standard of implementation and does not get involved with these tools. If the word \"noble\" rings a bell, you've come to the right place, because Art Deco is an unpopular software house. -->\n      <!-- focuses not on establishing new paradigms, but on following the ECMAScript standard the fluency of JavaScript as a functional programming language, its native capability for asynchronous operations and the basic mechanisms of sharing Open Source code that  -->\n    </p>\n    <!-- <section-break /> -->\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"text-center col-lg-3 align-self-stretch mb-3 text-center\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/seamless.jpg); background-position: 0 0px;\" id=\"c74268\">\n    \n        <div class=\"d-flex justify-content-center\" style=\"height:100%;\">\n          <img src=\"img/images2.png\" class=\"img-fluid align-self-center\">\n        </div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <h3>Examples Of Innovative Contributions</h3>\n    <p>\n      As a <em>Node.JS</em> development company, we were not happy with the state-of-art that existed in the field.
