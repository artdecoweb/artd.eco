In other words: life will kick you in the balls. Especially so when you think outside the box and have a unique and independent world view. The society that promises its members security, well paid jobs and fast cars, in exchange for them burning out lives for corporate interests, will betray anyone who challenges the system, testing his/her vision and how much they really want to go their own way. One's goal is to persevere despite the challenge and develop a reality tunnel in which the problems that are faced are only to the advantage, to forge a personality that is capable of true success and not some cheap pastiche of a human achievement. Today, I'll first tell you my dare to struggle dare to win story as a background, and then explain a set of 10 life lessons that I learned in the course of last year when a used a .sucks domain to build a website to put up a fight.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"overflow: hidden;\">\n  <img alt=\"Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes\"\n    src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='175' height='300'/%3E\" data-io style=\"float: right;\" class=\"ml-3\" data-src=\"life-sucks/img/prop.jpg\">\n  <noscript>\n    <img alt=\"Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes\" style=\"float: right;\" class=\"ml-3\"\n      src=\"life-sucks/img/prop.jpg\">\n  </noscript> I'm now 26 years old, almost 27 and I had spent 10 years in England prior to August 2018, when with a help of the UK's corrupt pseudo-endorsing body in the technology sector I had to pack up my shit and leave, because Tech Nation, that provides Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visas for talented young individuals who can benefit the sector, in reality has hijacked the visa to exploit it as a loophole for venture-backed businesses invested in by its directors. A lot of people assume that the UK is a fair democracy and a developed country, and don't realise that it's being transformed into a close technocracy run by the elite &mdash; a bunch of amoral capitalists with links in the government who try to run a country like it's a start-up. Eventually they will end up like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2LwIiKhczo\"><span class=\"tm\">wework</span></a>, and ruin the whole country, making people <span class=\"tm\">misswork</span>. To start real political education, everyone must <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda:_The_Formation_of_Men%27s_Attitudes\">\n   pick up this book</a> from their local library to learn the basis of how technological societies function. Tech Nation is a mere propaganda tool the government uses to make their activity seem legit and justified, and here's why.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div\n    class=\"col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column\">\n    <p style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n      The 2011 website states: <span class=\"tm\">The Tech City Investment Organisation (TCIO) is dedicated to driving investment to the area.

Yet Tech Nation apparently IS an endorsing body, and although they've stepped up from simple \"networking\" advice to proper knee-deep, \"government contacts\" corruption scheme (see below), they still hire 0 professionals in computing who would be able to properly assess applications.\n</p>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"fig-9848\"\n    class=\"col-lg-6 order-2 order-lg-1 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img alt=\"Tech City 2011 Web Site\"\n        src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1050' height='827'/%3E\" data-io class=\"border rounded img-fluid\"\n        data-src=\"life-sucks/img/appshot-Safari-Tech.gif\">\n      <noscript>\n        <img alt=\"Tech City 2011 Web Site\" class=\"border rounded img-fluid\"\n          src=\"life-sucks/img/appshot-Safari-Tech.gif\">\n      </noscript>\n    </p>\n    <h5 id=\"figure-1-tech-city-2011-web-site\" class=\"m-0 d-inline-block\" style=\"background: white;\">\n      Figure 1: Tech City 2011 Web Site\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"position-absolute\" style=\"opacity: 0; top: 1rem; right: 1rem;\" id=\"ce513\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"#\">Go Back</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  The <em>Exceptionally Talented Visa</em> route in the UK is the best one in the world, as it does not require you to have any capital when entering GB, and you can settle in the country in 3-5 years. However, when there are real endorsing bodies, such as <em>The Royal Academy of Engineering, Arts Council England, Royal Society</em> and <em>British Society</em> that were granted their Royal Charters and employ respectable fellows to process applications, Tech Nation used to be a little Shoreditch-based start-up that initially was helping the \"silicon valley\" of London, the Silicon Roundabout, with operations. In 2012, it was granted the \"endorsing\" body status by David Cameron, in the beginning of the government's bid to develop \"tech\" economy that benefits the establishment at the expense of tax payers and call it by the nice name \"<em>Industrial Strategy</em>\", using the myth of technological progress as a pretence to hide the real activity of industrialised corruption behind people's gullibility triggered by the idea that progress = better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  By the way, there's already an organisation called <em>British Computer Society</em> which has the ability to provide IT professionals with a <a href=\"https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/become-chartered/chartered-it-professional/\">charter</a> (in Engineering, chartering is normal but not when you're a Software Engineer for some reason), but it's not nearly as good as Tech Nation to do the job: <em>BCS</em> actually has Computer Scientists (who number 0 at Tech Nation) and the Royal Charter (that numbers -1 at Tech Nation), but only when you have 0 honour, you can do the job that Tech Nation is doing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Don't believe me? Here's a quick sneak peek into their scheme and how Tech Nation is playing its dirty role in it. I single out each player in this unfolding techno-capitalist drama and briefly critique them to draw a bigger picture. Let's just start by looking at the key figure from the <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08843778/officers\">list of directors</a> of Tech Nation, and set off from there.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"-eileen-burbidge-mdash\">Â Eileen BURBIDGE &mdash;</h3>\n\n<p>\n  \"American venture capitalist, founding partner at Passion Capital.\" (Forbes), and a chair at Tech Nation. The key is <strong>venture capitalist</strong>, because the whole of Tech Nation's purpose is to serve venture capitalists like Ms Burbidge and her friends. Her <em>Passion Capital</em> company is located at White Bear Yard, Shoreditch and is a co-working space for trendy entrepreneurs, building \"startups\". In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swIoyaBUpEg\">Wired Documentary</a> (1:20), Ms Burbidge talks about how \"more than a half, if not two-thirds, of the businesses are from foreign-born entrepreneurs\". She says how fantastic it is, but she's a typical capitalist liar, who will say anything that presents reality in the light that supports their mode of power regardless of facts. If she is not a liar, why her company Tech Nation which I paid &pound;456 for processing of my application, is treating me like shit and robbing me of an opportunity to be a foreign-born entrepreneur in London, which is what makes London so fantastic according to her?\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div id=\"fig-74268\"\n    class=\"col d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f1\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img alt=\"Capitalist Liar Eileen Burbidge in Wired's 15min film praising London's tech culture.\"\n        data-potrace=\"life-sucks/img/burbidge.jpg.svg\" id=\"sp82466\"\n        src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1708' height='960'/%3E\" class=\"border rounded img-fluid ImageHolder\">\n      <noscript>\n        <picture id=\"p82466\" class=\"border rounded\">\n          <source\n            srcset=\"life-sucks/img/burbidge-1600.webp 1600w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-1366.webp 1366w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-1024.webp 1024w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-768.webp 768w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-641.webp 641w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-319.webp 319w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-1708.webp 1708w\" type=\"image/webp\">\n          <img onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\"\n            alt=\"Capitalist Liar Eileen Burbidge in Wired's 15min film praising London's tech culture.\" src=\"life-sucks/img/burbidge.jpg\"\n            srcset=\"life-sucks/img/burbidge-1600.jpg 1600w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-1366.jpg 1366w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-1024.jpg 1024w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-768.jpg 768w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-641.jpg 641w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-319.jpg 319w\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n        </picture>\n      </noscript>\n    </p>\n    <h5 id=\"figure-2-capitalist-liar-eileen-burbidge-in-wireds-15min-film-praising-londons-tech-culture\"\n      class=\"m-0 d-inline-block\" style=\"background: white;\">\n      Figure 2: Capitalist Liar Eileen Burbidge in Wired's 15min film praising London's tech culture.\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"position-absolute\" style=\"opacity: 0; top: 1rem; right: 1rem;\" id=\"c6965\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"#\">Go Back</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div class=\"col-lg-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column\">\n    <p>\n      Maybe I'm too harsh, she's just a director, she's not really aware of the unfair unethical practices at her company, or does she? The answer is yes she does, because after Tech Nation's Senior Manager lied about my application, I made a website, and sent it to each member of their useless team, consisting of 0 software engineers and who would have no idea who's actually telling the truth. I had a premium membership at the time and accumulated 45 credits, so right before Christmas Tech Nation's staff got a little message from me.\n    </p>\n      <p>\n        Needless to say, none of the cowards dared to answer anything, because they are despicable traitors of the country who think they can give visas in technology without even knowing basics of computer programming and have no courage to really look into the issue, preferring to ignore it altogether. Fine for them, but a director of a company needs to investigate reports like that, yet Burbidge is JUST a dishonourable liar who's there to tell everyone how \"fantastic\" things are without leadership skills that would prompt her to ask me what happened.\n      </p>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"fig-80\"\n    class=\"col-lg-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f2\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img alt=\"Burbidge Linkedin message\"\n        src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='833' height='559'/%3E\" data-io class=\"border rounded img-fluid\" data-src=\"life-sucks/img/linkedin.gif\">\n      <noscript>\n        <img alt=\"Burbidge Linkedin message\" class=\"border rounded img-fluid\"\n          src=\"life-sucks/img/linkedin.gif\">\n      </noscript>\n    </p>\n    <h5 id=\"figure-3-burbidge-linkedin-message\" class=\"m-0 d-inline-block\" style=\"background: white;\">\n      Figure 3: Burbidge Linkedin message\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"position-absolute\" style=\"opacity: 0; top: 1rem; right: 1rem;\" id=\"c8e80\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"#\">Go Back</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img alt=\"section break\"\n      src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='40' height='15'/%3E\" data-io data-src=\"/section-breaks/0.svg\">\n    <noscript><img alt=\"section break\" src=\"/section-breaks/0.svg\"></noscript></a>\n</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"publicio-mdash\">Public.IO &mdash;</h3>\n\n<p>\n  <img alt=\"Daniel Korski From Daily Mail\" data-potrace=\"life-sucks/img/korski.jpg.svg\" id=\"sp65987\"\n    src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='193' height='692'/%3E\" class=\"img-fluid ImageHolder\" style=\"float:right;width:193px\">\n  <noscript>\n    <picture id=\"p65987\" style=\"float:right;width:193px\">\n      <source srcset=\"life-sucks/img/korski-193.webp 193w\" type=\"image/webp\">\n      <img onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"Daniel Korski From Daily Mail\"\n        src=\"life-sucks/img/korski.jpg\" srcset=\"life-sucks/img/korski-193.jpg 193w\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n    </picture>\n  </noscript>But who else was registered at White Bear Yard? Maybe just <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10608507/filing-history\">PUBLIC.IO</a> which moved out there in 2018: <strong>Registered office address changed from White Bear Yard 144a Clerkenwell Road London EC1R 5DF United Kingdom to 25 Eccleston Place London SW1W 9NF on 7 February 2018</strong>. This company is a $100+ mil fund run by Daniel Korski, former special adviser to David Cameron who set up Public.IO just 5 days after Cameron resigned, to offer \"growth programs\" to businesses wanting to sell to government, or the so-called \"gov-tech\", i.e., money laundering scheme consisting of securing government contracts through bought officials in Westminster, however it's not illegal because well that's how institutionalised corruption in England works nowadays. The logic goes: if you <strong>yourself</strong> believe what you're doing to rob people of a country is legit, then it must be. Typical capitalist thinking: according to <a href=\"/dm-korski\">Daily Mail</a>, PublicIO \"offers access to advisers working at the highest levels in government\", including advisers for <strong>Health Secretary</strong> Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Amber Rudd. In fact, the same article mentions how Burbidge was appointed by Korski, so obviously they are good pals and form what I call \"the establishment\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  But so what Burbidge is a partner at a venture capital based firm, it doesn't stop her from being a director of Tech Nation, right (actually before her, it was run by a non-venture capitalist and was pretty useless, so useless that CEO of Hubble said that TN is not even needed)? I wouldn't object if Tech Nation was a private company helping all these \"tech startups\" using their own venture capitals but do they? No, they are sponsored by the Government and are paid &pound;5 mil annually from tax payers' money, so that a bunch of people, who are already rich, can have \"favourable\" conditions. And you know, fuck them overall and let them play their little \"build your own technology\" constructor with nurses' and each other member's of the society money, but not only do they force their technology bubble hype upon the whole country, but <strong>ALSO</strong> actively sabotage applications for visas of people like me who just think differently from them and is not part of their \"who is your investor\" game. The real nature of Tech Nation's activity is proved by the screenshot below, which is also completely aligned with Korski's own policy of PublicIO.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div\n    class=\"col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column\">\n    <p style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n      So it is <em>OK</em> now in a developed country to set up agencies that provide with \"direct contacts in Government\"?

Does that not sound like a conflict of interest, and also why <em>should</em> they provide such assistance, when the visa is for talented independent individuals and not really for tech businesses per se? This is because the visa is not for exceptionally talented, skilled young and passionate people. It is the visa for the talent farm of this startup ecosystem, where companies who want to provide proper sponsorship to employees use the Tech Nation visa as a loophole to hire \"talent\" who is not talent at all, but are typical workforce in the IT. Economists don't have the ET1 visa, nor do lawyers, because they just do their job. This is what 99% of all Tech Nation visa holders do, just their job. But people who deserve it the most, for whom Software Development and Computing, is the real creative process, like it would be for a proper artist, have to be discriminated against by a pseudo-endorsing body that thinks it's an authority to decide who can start businesses in the UK, which is not even legal according to the European legal framework (E-commerce directive):\n</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n  1. Member States shall ensure that the taking up and pursuit of the activity of an information society service provider may not be made subject to prior authorisation or any other requirement having equivalent effect.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n  This rule is there because it's essential human freedom of anyone to start a business, especially a digital one, today. It's like the freedom of speech. Can you imagine how offended you would be if there would be someone that you would have to go to ask to start a business, and they refused you that? You'd be enraged. Well, that's what Tech Nation has done to me, by lying about all of my achievements that I submitted to them in the application.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  I mentioned creativity just above, because I don't think I'm a developer, I'm an artist and a master of my craft. My company is called <a href=\"https://www.artd.eco\">Art Deco&trade;</a>, and you can't get more art than that when you own a software company. Software development is the thing I do best in life, because I express myself with it finding an escape, and because there are techniques and processes, like in any other art, that are employed to achieve the result &mdash; testing, documentation, transpilation and building. For each of them, I created my own tool that matches my criteria of quality: <a\n   title=\"The 2019 Most Modern Testing Framework For Node.JS With Test Contexts (Reusable BeforeEach / AfterEach Via Separate Files); Masks (Inputs/Outputs In Non-Js Files) And Fork Testing; Interactive Snapshots.\" class=\"NPMBadge\" href=\"https://npmjs.com/package/zoroaster\">\n   <span class=\"a\">Zoroaster</span><span class=\"b\">4.1.2</span></a> context-testing framework, <a\n   title=\"Documentation Compiler To Generate The Table Of Contents, Embed Examples With Their Output, Make Markdown Tables, Maintain Typedefs For JavaScript And README, Watch Changes To Push, Use Macros And Prettify API Titles.\" class=\"NPMBadge\" href=\"https://npmjs.com/package/documentary\">\n   <span class=\"a\">Documentary</span><span class=\"b\">1.34.1</span></a> documentation engine, <a\n   title=\"A Regex-Based Transpiler Of Source Code To Allow Writing Import And Export Statements And JSX With 0 Dependencies.\" class=\"NPMBadge\" href=\"https://npmjs.com/package/alamode\">\n   <span class=\"a\">ÃLaMode</span><span class=\"b\">3.2.0</span></a> transpiler for modules and JSX, <a\n   title=\"Front-End Code Bundler and Proper Node.js Package Compiler With Closure Compiler.

That my software is \"tools that nobody uses built using a number frameworks\". These are words of a \"professional highly-qualified expert in the field\" lol when I show that I CREATE frameworks and not use them. Like just stop for a sec and think how this pure libel makes me feel &mdash; OK I know this is a lie, but there are other people reading this like the Home Office who don't know that Tech Nation are corrupt bastards. This is when my software is 100% Open Source and takes productivity and developer experience literally to the next level. I know I'm natural at software, and am the only person who really deserved the visa out of all the propaganda puppets calling themselves Tech Nation visa holders who are recruited to put the smoke in the eyes of the public \"how well the UK is doing helping the technology sector\". The reason I didn't get the visa is exactly because I'm an Open Source developer, and it's not to the advantage of capitalists to help Open Source. Tech Nation is supposed to be an independent endorsing body for the technology sector, but instead, they are just capitalists' flunkeys sabotaging the UK's economy and abusing candidates while being on public payroll.\n    </p>\n      <p>\n        Moreover, <em>Art Deco</em> is a style that emerged exactly 100 years ago, as a way to reconcile the newest technological processes with human culture. Deco starts for decoratif, because you don't want to live in a sterile factory-like environment, and have to introduce motives from nature, use materials like wood, i.e. to attribute to proper <em>culture</em> that is in the deepest core of the human being. Art Deco is for everyone who want to believe in a powerful human spirit and be religious but without affiliation with the church. Tech Nation is precisely the degeneration of culture, when everything is bought with money, there is no respect for human beings and everything is synthetic.\n      </p>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"fig-57253\"\n    class=\"col-lg-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f4\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img alt=\"I don't build in order to have clients.

<div class=\"col-lg-6 order-lg-2 order-1\">\n    <p>\n      Right, maybe things are not so bad, it's just a bunch of capitalists helping each other? OK let's look at another Tech Nation's ex director, <strong>Robin Klein</strong> (22 September 2015 &mdash; 15 June 2018) who together with his son Saul founded <em>LocalGlobe</em>, a seed round investment fund. LocalGlobal, apart from many other investment, also <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/echo-8-seed--730e481c#section-overview\">invests</a> in a company called Echo, which invents an alarm for taking medicine, and allows to order your prescription via an app (ofc this is super high-tech innovation isn't it). Personally, I think it's a ridiculous idea: Echo's founder said that he suffered from depression so that he wanted to get his antidepressants via post. That's just stupid, if you have depression, what you need to do is to get out as much as possible, and use any excuse to visit the outside world and interact with other humans. That allows the healthy flow of serotonin and actually improves the mood and heals your depression.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      On the other hand, ordering anti-depression pills via post, will isolate you even more wouldn't it? But that's exactly what <em>Tech Nation</em> and the Government want, to destroy any normal human ways of living, transform a society into a technocracy in which everyone is depressed, send them their pills by post, while streamlining all the public money into the pockets of the elite. Look just how much Tech Nation is happy for the acquisition of Echo by an American pharma company. The reason these corrupt liars who are pretending to benefit the society are so happy is actually because their director, Robin Klein, is going to be making money off the population.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  But that's not all, not at all. Their high innovation multi-million alarm clock for taking medicine would be absolutely useless, if not their affiliation with NHS. There's a new branch of NHS, which is called NHSX, that was put there, by official version, to digitalise the National Health Service and modernise it. The real reason this unit is there, like the whole of the UK's capitalist technology, is to funnel the money out of the treasury into capitalists' hands and present it like they are doing a service to the society, and improving the standard of living. Who else, except for Tech Nation is excited about the Echo acquisition?\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-lg-6 order-lg-1 order-2\">\n    <p>\n      Of course Saul is happy for his daddy's successful exit. The more money the better. But you might be wondering who is <span class=\"tm\">@matthewsgould</span>, and why Saul is cc'ing him at such an exciting moment? Well, Matthew Gould is his old pal, who was a British ambassador to Israel, when Mr Klein was the UK's first tech envoy to Israel, announced by David Cameron himself in Dec 2012, around the same time all this Tech Nation's thing started.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-lg-6 order-lg-2 order-1\">\n    <div class=\"EmbeddedTweet my-auto\">\n      <div class=\"EmbeddedTweet-tweetContainer\">\n        <div class=\"a\">\n          <blockquote class=\"b\">\n            <div class=\"c\">\n              <a aria-label=\"Saul Klein\" class=\"e\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cape\">\n                <img alt=\"Saul Klein\" data-io class=\"Avatar\"\n                  data-src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/754440508018135040/hSqk3Tnf_normal.jpg\">\n                <noscript>\n                  <img alt=\"Saul Klein\" class=\"Avatar\"\n                    src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/754440508018135040/hSqk3Tnf_normal.jpg\">\n                </noscript></a>\n              <div class=\"f\">\n                <a aria-label=\"Saul Klein\" class=\"TweetAuthor-link Identity u-linkBlend\"\n                  href=\"https://twitter.com/cape\">\n                  <div class=\"j\">\n                    <span class=\"h\">\n                      <span class=\"i\" title=\"Saul Klein\">Saul Klein</span>\n                      <span class=\"k\">\n                        <div class=\"o l\" aria-label=\"Verified Account\" title=\"Verified Account\" role=\"img\"></div>\n                      </span>\n                    </span>\n                    <span class=\"g\" title=\"@cape\" dir=\"ltr\">@cape</span>\n                  </div></a>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"p\">\n                <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cape/status/1141457142614044672\">\n                  <span class=\"FollowButton-bird\">\n                    <div class=\"o n\" aria-label=\"View on Twitter\" title=\"View on Twitter\" role=\"presentation\"></div>\n                  </span></a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d\">\n              <p class=\"Tweet-text e-entry-title\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n                Exciting times ahead - congrats to team cc <a target=\"_blank\" dir=\"ltr\" data-mentioned-user-id=\"744276787279069200\"\n   class=\"twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewsgould\">\n   @<b>matthewsgould</b></a><a target=\"_blank\" dir=\"ltr\"\n  data-expanded-url=\"https://twitter.com/localglobevc/status/1141340347399835648\" title=\"https://twitter.com/localglobevc/status/1141340347399835648\"\n  class=\"twitter-timeline-link u-hidden\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://t.co/g9lJzXQ2uH\">\n  <span class=\"tco-ellipsis\"></span><span class=\"js-display-url\">twitter.com/localglobevc/s</span><span class=\"tco-ellipsis\">â¦</span></a>\n              </p>\n              <div class=\"q\">\n                <div class=\"TweetInfo-like\">\n                  <a title=\"Like\" class=\"r\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1141457142614044672\">\n                    <div><div class=\"o m\" aria-label=\"Like\" title=\"Like\" role=\"img\"></div></div>\n                    <span class=\"s\">2</span></a>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"t\">\n                  <a class=\"u-linkBlend\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cape/status/1141457142614044672\">\n                    <time dateTime=\"6/20/2019, 12:26:04 AM\" class=\"dt-updated\"\n                      title=\"Time posted: 2:26 pm - 19 Jun 2019\">\n                      2:26 pm - 19 Jun 2019</time></a>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </blockquote>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  Mr <a href=\"/tic\">Cameron said</a> that the UK âwants to work much more closely with Israel on innovation and technology.â, and in fact the British Embassy in Israel has been transformed into a tech hub, because apparently GB and Israel as such great friends. Just so we're on the same page, Kleins, Gould and Cameron, Korski are all Jewish, in fact Matthew Gould is a passionate Zionist, whereas a Zionist, according to the <abbr title=\"World Zionist Organization\">WZO</abbr> is <strong>a Jew who understood the Zionist meaning of the Jewish State and was prepare to sacrifice himself for it</strong>. The truth is, Cameron as well as Boris Johnson also declared themselves Zionists, and Cameron received &pound;1m from British Jewery without which he would never have been a PM. And you still think the UK is a democracy in any way?
