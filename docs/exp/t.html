    <p>
      Software Engineering is an art, science and technology combined. It helps to automate processes and improve the standard of living, relieving humans of monotonous operations that can be solved using a computer program. 100 years ago, with the advent of new machinery, there was a promise for the future where people's time could be taken off of work, and put into spending their lives focusing on human tasks and communications. This has partly been achieved, but we have a long way to go still, and after reaching the required stage of progress in hardware, we are now peaking in the course of software evolution. The species that is increasingly dominating the environment and taking the central stage in this process of natural selection of the fittest is <em>Node.JS</em>. It is no surprise that in today's word, characterised by globalisation and interconnectedness, the programming language born on the web, is becoming <em>The One</em> of the web, who will redeem it and remake it in the way it's supposed to be.

      By bridging the gap between front-end development and back-end programming, and utilising the agility of functional paradigm together with the abstractions of OOP that help developer experience and documentation, <em>Node.JS</em> is winning hearts and souls and finding hundreds of new fans, both indie developers as well as development companies, all over the world each day. The applications of today designed to connect services, users and automatons can benefit the most when they are written in <em>Node.JS</em>, and <strong>Art Deco</strong> specialises in this field of modern web computing, applying the best practises of classical software engineering such as thorough automated testing, documentation plentiful of examples, and user-centered design together with more present-day trends of cloud and serverless deployment, single-page and progressive web apps and open source code coordination techniques like NPM scopes and GitHub orgs that help to pass the codebase between hired and future teams. Our approach is that each program is a piece of art that can be perfected to the single line of code by employing a scientific method that consists of conducting research to understand the problem at hand, coming up with a possible solution, evaluating it against business requirements while rigorously and critically documenting the findings. The outcome is technology that is unique to each client, easy and pleasant to use for her customers and stakeholders, and straightforward to understand and maintain for other teams of developers.

      Art Deco is a style that came into existence almost a hundred years ago and stretched for a few decades, and although the early French "high" Art Deco is mainly presented in the works of sculptors and textile and furniture designers, the majority would recognise it for everything modern that appeared in the 1920s: skyscrapers, ocean liners, cinemas and home technology such as radios.
      Because tech is always logical and scientific, it is reflected in Art Deco's usage of geometrical shapes as influenced by cubism, however what makes it <em>decorative</em> is its ability to keep in touch with nature â€” Art Deco's themes would more often than not incorporate animal and plant life, so that people can feel more relaxed at home. It also portrays human as a powerful spiritual entity that with his mind is conquering the world and creating a better future. All of these concepts are the foundation of the philosophy of our company: we believe that the human race at the moment is going through the next coil of technological emergence and the last century has laid the foundations for the development of the web, cloud computing and AI. Despite the benefits that technology brings us, we also recognise its potential to lead people astray and consume them, rather than being consumed, so we stand by the intrinsic human values such as face-to-face communication and connectedness with nature and advocate the good use of technology that helps to maintain those morals but does not replace them. Finally, we highly appreciate aristocratic virtues such as rationality and integrity, reject mainstream opinions and work on making noble software that through its quality and modern simplicity improves the world.

      In our code, we use both functional and object-oriented approaches according to the problem being solved, as well as the latest standard of JavaScript programming language with EcmaScript modules and the most up-to-date syntax including object spread and rest operators, arrow and async functions and JSX components. When others choose to stick to the previous version of the standard and keep using <span class="tm">require</span> statements instead of imports just because <em>Node.JS</em> has not added the support for the later and install Babel for their <em>JSX</em>, we created our own 0-dependency transpiler <a href="/alamode.html">Ã€LaMode</a>, which offers a unique solution by transpiling the source code using regular expressions, and allows to write modern code without being paused by insufficiencies of the runtime. Like the transpiler, our implementations are free of external code and are straight to the point: they focus on solving the problem at hand with the maximum help of the language itself so that no client's time is wasted on setting up and adjusting 3rd party tools. If you're looking for a <em>Node.JS</em> development company that shows it can implement its own toolchain for daily work and thus proves its expertise, rather than just takes a free solution used by everyone else, choose <em>Art Deco</em>. Then your software won't be like anyone else's.

      Quality Assurance is the field where <em>Art Deco</em> is second to none. We have invented a testing framework called <em><a href="/zoroaster.html">Zoroaster</a></em> that introduces the concept of context-testing into the JS world and helps us and other developers to keep their testing infrastructure separate from test cases' flow, document it and receive in-editor documentation hints on how to use its methods, verify its correctness to ensure double standard of quality assurance (the so-called <em>testing the tests</em> practice), and share it across packages to save valuable time that will be spent on coding and writing tests. Most of our JavaScript functions are written in pure, functional style that allows them to undergo elementary unit-testing using the mask-testing feature of <em>Zoroaster</em>, where test logic for each method is setup only once, while we concentrate on comparing mappings of inputs to outputs in the most efficient manner. Final systems are covered by integration tests on different levels, including integration between modules as well as between APIs, browsers and cloud services. Automated testing not only proves the correctness of programs and their meeting of the requirements specification, but also serves as a regression basecamp that guarantees that any future changes won't break the existing implementation.

      Creating programs is not just about writing code and returning it to the client. Documentation is an integral part of the process that helps to keep track of work that was done by exposing it to developers and other project participants in natural language, diagrams and examples. By providing 100% documentation coverage, our <em>Node.JS</em> development company makes sure that the execution of each feature of the system can be reproduced and understood by someone who is not an advanced specialist in it. It also serves as an outer layer of quality assurance, since by embedding examples and running them to compile documentation, we can visually see that the system is working as expected, and any unanticipated changes will be picked up by the documentation writer when submitting the code to source control system (e.g., GitHub). Furthermore, when it comes to maintenance, documentation will always aid in getting organised very quickly and catching up with ideas that the initial develop put into practice. Art Deco is a big fan of pure JSDoc and does not employ <em>TypeScript</em>, but we go beyond simply annotating methods in code. Our practice involves writing type files in XML format, where each configuration option is described. The types are then embedded both in README files, as well as the source code, so that there is a single source of truth. In addition, we also programmed a <em><a href="/documentary.html">Documentary</a></em> documentation framework, that provides maximum productivity for us by allowing to automatically embed examples and their output, and cache it which saves an extraordinary amount of time so that our clients don't have to pay for our developers copying and pasting code into the guidelines manually each time there's a change.

       Optimisation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since our source code is written in ES6, and organised by NPM packages, we had to find a way to deliver the final product which is compatible with browsers, or is easy to install as a Node.JS system. To achieve that, we use <em><a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler">Google Closure Compiler</a></em> that puts source files together and produces an output with advanced optimisations, such as peep-hole optimisation, variable name mangling and others. The compiled JavaScript code is smaller in size and can be transmitted to users' browsers faster, but it also allows to us to write modern JavaScript, without having to worry about older browser compatibility. On top of that, we also minify websites' CSS files (rename class names, remove whitespace, <em>etc</em>) and concatenate them into a single file for faster page load and thus greater user experience. Since the compiler had only been used for web bundles previously, we invented <a href="/depack.html">Depack</a>: the build tool that makes it possible to run the compiler against <em>Node.JS</em> programs and produce a single optimised executable binary or library file. This means that the gross package delivered as the overall system, be it a web server, CLI tool or a library to work with APIs, will not have any dependencies that take time to install and link, occupies less disk space, runs faster and can be shared with 3rd parties without worrying about revealing the source code, due to the fact that the output is obfuscated (the source maps are available to clients in separate files).

       NPM Packages
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em><a href="https://npmjs.org">NPM</a></em> is the package manager for <em>Node.JS</em> with almost 1 million packages being published online for free use. <em>Art Deco</em> recognises the value of Open Source, but also exploits the infrastructure created by NPM that allows to solve the dependency management problem with the ease of mind: when writing software for ourselves and clients, we split designs into logical packages, and create them separately using our package bootstrapper <a href="/mnp.html">MNP</a> (<span class="tm">my-new-package</span>) that spawns packages with the most up-to-date scaffolding. Smaller packages are then imported by larger ones, and all of them are published on NPM, either in private or public scopes (e.g., our Open Source projects). This approach ensures that any future software pieces can quickly install existing ones, whereas we save time and know that there's no bugs in installed code, because each package has been tested separately. Moreover, the philosophy behind packages is Unix-like, i.e., that programs should be simple and do mostly one thing, but do it really well. We have published over 150 packages that are really good in their implementation, testing and documentation, and when they are put together, they achieve tremendous results with superb quality. NPM allows us to apply the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle in practice of software engineering, and organise code by scopes: we can create a scope for our clients and share the access permissions with them, so that all the infrastructure can be handed over quickly, securely and responsibly.
